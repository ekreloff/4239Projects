Simple Calculator - Ethan Kreloff
HW1 CSCI 4239  

Took 10 hours to complete.

Sorry I had to resubmit this, I got behind trying to get Qt and OpenGL installed. 

You can use it like a real calculator, however there are a couple caveats:

1. Only the first operation button you press will take effect.
2. You can change what base is used to display the number, however it will stay that way until you change it back to decimal even if you press clear.
3. Since calculators represent such a broad range of numbers, I had to limit the maximum number so that the opengl display would change with smaller increments. Numbers over 100 and less than 1000 are the best to see the visualization.
4. You must clear before starting a new calculation if you want the OpenGL visualization for the new claculation.
