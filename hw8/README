TIME SPENT: 16 hours


This program demonstrates the use of stored textures on a cube. The granite texture uses noise to create the effect as does the marble. 

This was my backup plan after trying for hours to get a bump map going. I was having trouble getting the correct tangent vectors and so the whole thing looked really bad. I will try to get it working at some point because I want to use bump maps in my final project, but for now this is what I have. 


Arrow Keys: Control rotation of the scene up/down left/right

‘m’  	: Change shading mode

‘[‘ ‘]’ : Moves light around cube

'i'/'o' : Zooms in/out by increasing/decreasing scale factor by one quarter. 

‘z’     : turn axes on and off

'esc'	: Hit escape to quit.
