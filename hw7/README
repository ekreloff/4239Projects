This program demonstrates the different effects of image processing filters on a rotatable scene that draws a dinosaur model. This code is based off of the image processing example from CSCI 4239.




Arrow Keys: Control rotation of the scene up/down left/right

‘m’  	: Change shading mode

’n’/’N’ : Increases/decreases number of filter passes

'i'/'o' : Zooms in/out by increasing/decreasing scale factor by one quarter. 

‘z’     : turn axes on and off

'esc'	: Hit escape to quit.
