This program demonstrates the use of a vertex shader to move particles around to look like  snow in the wind. I wanted to expand on this by making the snow look better through the geometry shader, but I could not for the life of me figure out why my geometry shader wouldn’t compile. Whenever I started the program it gave me a cryptic “Could not compile shader1.geom”, so eventually I just got frustrated after continuous failure and just stuck with this. Hopefully this is enough for the assignment.
