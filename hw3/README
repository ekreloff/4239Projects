This program demonstrates a very simple procedural shader on a sphere. 
It draws lines on the sphere while also tinting the spheres color based 
on its position in space. 


Arrow Keys: Control rotation of the scene up/down left/right

‘m’	: Change shading mode

'i'/'o' : Zooms in/out by increasing/decreasing scale factor by one quarter. 

'x' 	: Resets all values above back to default.

‘z’     : turn axes on and off

'['/']' : Move light left or right.

'esc'	: Hit escape to quit.
